      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Not everyone has artistic talents, however a big part of business is how visually appealing a person’s, or company's product is. There are also people out there that want art unrelated to a job such as people who want the character designed, or a tattoo they like. I help people take what they are imagining in their head and put it on paper.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience are people seeking personalized character designs. The main people using my site will be individuals with a penchant for creativity and storytelling, my target audience includes aspiring writers, gamers, and other creative individuals who struggle to create visual content for their ideas. I will also do commissions for people who what art unrelated to character design, but they will not be my focus.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello! Welcome to Skystone Designs, where your creative journey begins!
      </p>
      <p>
        My turnaround time for commissions is flexible and tailored to your communication pace. On average, projects are completed within a week or two, but this timeframe can adjust based on your responsiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily do requests for character designs and concept art, however I do also specialize in crafting logos, tattoos, and more. Simply head to the commissions page to kickstart your project. Please note, I do not accept commissions for explicit content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prices start at $30 for logos and simple designs, $40 for tattoo designs, $50 for background design and $60 for character designs. For commissions not listed, an estimate will be sent via email for you to approve before I begin your project. You are allowed to request up to two revisions of the project; after that, it will be $10 extra per revision. Let's bring your ideas to life!
